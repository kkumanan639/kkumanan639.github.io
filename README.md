# Air Quality System							                   		        	                        
-	Built system that monitors CO2, temperature and humidity and displays values on an LCD
-	Design was implemented using an AVR128DB48 and was programmed in C
-	Utilized I2C, SPI, USART communication protocols to interface to external peripherals

# Ant Maze   												 
-	Wrote a program in c to solve a maze that was inputted as a text file with the help of some data structures 
  and a Finite-state Machine

# Controller for TC514 Precision Analog Front End         				           
-	wrote the controller to control the four phases of operation of a dual slope integrating ADC
-	Designed using VHDL and ran on the Lattice LCMXO3L-6900C FPGA

# AVR Thermometer   						
-	Created an embedded system that utilized an external temperature sensor and the built-in ADC in the AVR128DB48 to measure and display the temperature on a seven-segment display
-	Learned how to read datasheets and basic embedded systems concepts such as polling, interrupts, debouncing and read-modify-write
