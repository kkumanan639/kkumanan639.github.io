# Capstone Project (in progress) : Auto-Connect Wireless Monitor System for Electric Vehicles
- Designing an embedded system to support and automated data communication link
- link is established whenever RF module from car is close to RF module in charging station
- Module is supposed to interface to both the charger, battery management system and the PC

# Air Quality Board							                   		        	                        
-	Designed PCB on Altium Designer that monitors CO2, temperature and humidity and displays values on an LCD
  and the computer using either USB or RS232
-	Design utilized design principles to minimize EMI, ground bounce and crosstalk

# [Air Quality System](https://github.com/kkumanan639/Air_Quality_System)							                   		        	                        
-	Built system that monitors CO2, temperature and humidity and displays values on an LCD
-	Design was implemented using an AVR128DB48 and was programmed in C
-	Utilized I2C, SPI, USART communication protocols to interface to external peripherals

# Stock Tracer visualization tool
- Scraped Reddit and Twitter for mentions of the stock and looked at how it affected stock price
- Plotted the projected price of the stock as well as the buy rating
- Utilized Python and its numpy and pandas library
- Won best finance hack for HopperHacks 2022

# [Controller for TC514 Precision Analog Front End](https://github.com/kkumanan639/TC514_Precision_Controller)         				           
-	Wrote the controller to control the four phases of operation of a dual slope integrating ADC
-	Designed using VHDL and ran on the Lattice LCMXO3L-6900C FPGA

# [AVR Thermometer](https://github.com/kkumanan639/Embedded_temperature_sensor)   						
-	Created an embedded system that utilized an external temperature sensor and the built-in ADC in the AVR128DB48 to measure and display the temperature on a seven-       segment display
-	Learned how to read datasheets and basic embedded systems concepts such as polling, interrupts, debouncing and read-modify-write

# [Ant Maze](https://github.com/Adgamby/ESE_124_Project_S2021)   												 
-	Wrote a program in C to solve a maze that was inputted as a text file with the help of some data structures 
  and a Finite-state Machine

# [Text Based Adventure Game](https://github.com/kkumanan639/Midterm_project)
- Created a text based adventure game in C++ that utilizes different data structures like trees, queues, stacks and linked lists

# Percutaneous Endoscopic Gastronomy tube stabilizer
- Designed a device that stabilizes the tube for the percutaneous endoscopic gastronomy procedure
- The final stabilizer was designed on SolidWorks and printed using a 3D printer
- Won second price for three different categories: most market ready, good design principles, quality of poster presentation
