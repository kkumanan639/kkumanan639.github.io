# About:
Electrical Engineering and Physics student passionate about PCB design, embedded systems and power systems. Currently looking for entry level hardware roles. Other than that I love to run, play soccer and ultimate frisbee. Things that currently interest me are RF circuits and PCB routing for RF and high speed digital circuits; especially routing PCB's to reduce EMI and EMC effects as it intersect my love for electromagentics from Physics and circuit design from Electrical Engineering.


# Capstone Project (in progress) : Auto-Connect Wireless Monitor System for Electric Vehicles
- Designing an embedded system to support and automated data communication link
- link is established whenever RF module from car is close to RF module in charging station
- Module is supposed to interface to both the charger, battery management system and the PC

# Air Quality Board							                   		        	                        
-	Designed PCB on Altium Designer that monitors CO2, temperature and humidity and displays values on an LCD
  and the computer using either USB or RS232
-	Design utilized design principles to minimize EMI, ground bounce and crosstalk
